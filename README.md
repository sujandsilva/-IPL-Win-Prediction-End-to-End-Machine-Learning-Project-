Final Course Project of the course 'Introduction to Machine Learning' at IIT Bombay
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a big cricket event
where players from different parts of India and even other countries compete.
People who bet money or sponsor teams are really interested in predicting who
will win IPL matches. To make predictions, we look at things like which team has won
the toss, what is the choice of the team after winning the toss (bat/field) and if the team
is playing in the home ground or away. In a study, we have used Machine Learning
Models like SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest
Neighbor, Na√Øve Bayes and also the boosting algorithms to predict IPL match outcomes
